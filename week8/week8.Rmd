# Filter

Compared to **highlight** which dim non-selected traces and highlighted the selected trace, **filter** clears the graph and shows only the filtered data. 

Filter and highlight are actually provided by **crosstalk** package which **plotly** take advantage of its **filter and selection** functions.

  * [using crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html)

## Selectize.js
`crosstalk::filter_xxx` uses **selectize.js** which can be accessed through the DOM's selectize interface.

```{js}
/* choose all DOM with select tag */
selectDOM = document.querySelector("#country select")

control = selectDOM.selectize

control.setValue(["Argentina"])
```
